        <h2>Node.js</h2>
<p>Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript run-time environment that executes JavaScript code outside of a
    browser. Historically, JavaScript was used primarily for client-side scripting, in which scripts written in
    JavaScript are embedded in a webpage's HTML and run client-side by a JavaScript engine in the user's web browser.
    Node.js lets developers use JavaScript to write Command Line tools and for server-side scriptingâ€”running scripts
    server-side to produce dynamic web page content before the page is sent to the user's web browser. Consequently,
    Node.js represents a "JavaScript everywhere" paradigm,[6] unifying web application development around a single
    programming language, rather than different languages for server side and client side scripts.</p>
